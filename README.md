# Live Smart
Live Smart is a home automation system that allows users to control home appliances remotely through a Django-powered web application and an Android app using Bluetooth and internet-connected devices like BT Display. The system leverages machine learning to predict electricity bills in advance and provide insights into energy usage, contributing to an average 20% reduction in monthly utility expenses. ESP32 microcontrollers were used to connect and control devices such as lamps, fans, and lights.

Hardware Working

In this project, home appliances are controlled via Bluetooth and internet-connected devices like Google Assistant and Alexa. The BT Display Android app is used to send commands to control the devices. Three devices—lamp, fan, and light—are controlled by pairing the smartphone with the PC via Bluetooth. Commands are sent from the app, allowing users to control the devices according to the given instructions.
